# FE-Vegyro

A frontend application aimed at users who have little to no knowledge on growing their own vegetables. Vegryo gives users the relevant understanding to see the growth of their vegetables from planting to fruition. 
Users can insert their garden dimensions, choose vegetables from the list provided with information on planting and aftercare, view the amount of vegetables that can fit in the space provided, drag and drop to their preference and see how many days until harvest.
Built with React Native with data being requested from the backend project: https://github.com/janders4/Vegryo-BackEnd
